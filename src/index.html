              have been built on Wordpress with a lot of custom work done. The
              design reflects the desire of the team to have a news website that
              looked modern, professional and sharp.

              A redesign of the official website of the Graduate Student

              starter theme with the Bootstrap CSS framework integrated into it.
              The clean design incorporates a lot of white space and heavy usage
              of Northeastern University's official symbols and colors.
